# ipconfig.js

This utility returns the local ip address.  Copy the `ipconfig.js` to your application and simply call it (see below sample).

```javascript
var ipconfig = require('./ipconfig.js');
console.log(ipconfig.IPv4);
```

I only wrote this with node and IPv4.  However, other language or IP versions could be added.
